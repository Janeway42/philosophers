# **Philosophers**
Dining philosophers [problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem)

Input: 
-------
- number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
- time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didn’t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
- time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
- time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
- number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
philosopher dies.

- Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.
- Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers. Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philosopher number N + 1

Specific rules: 
---------------
- Each philosopher is a **thread**.
- There is **one fork** between each pair of philosophers. Therefore, if there are several philosophers, each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their right side. If there is only one philosopher, there should be only one fork on the table.
- To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, a mutex is used to protect the forks state for each one of them.
- The "philo" version uses mutexes and threads
- The "philo_bonus" version uses semaphores and processes (fork)

Run:
-----
- make
- ./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep (optional: number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat)
